============
Development
============

If you wish to hack the GnuCOBOL source code, proceed as follows.
If you build from svn the first 3 tools are always needed.

Before changing/building GnuCOBOL, you need to install the
following extra packages with versions equal or greater :

For compiling (when changing flex/bison sources):
  o Bison 2.3
  o Flex 2.5.35

For generating the testsuite (when changing any .at files)
  o autoconf 2.64

For generating the translation files (when changing any msgid)
  o gettext 0.17
    ** NOTE **
    If you don't need an up-to-date translation you can do 
    `touch po/*.pot po/*.po po/*.gmo` instead.

For generating the documentation
  o help2man 0.17
    ** NOTE **
    If you don't need an up-to-date manpage you can do 
    `touch cobc/*.1 bin/*.1` instead.
  o texinfo 4.12 (with texinfo-tex)
  o texlive (latest, texlive-collection-latex suffices)
    ** NOTE **
    If you don't need an up-to-date info source / manual you can do
    `touch doc/gnucobol.info doc/gnucobol.pdf` instead.

If you reconfigure and/or prepare a distribution
  o autoconf 2.64
  o automake 1.10.1
  o libtool 2.2.6
  o m4 1.4.12

If you modify top-level configure.ac or Makefile.am in any directory then
you will need to run "autoreconf -I m4" to regenerate the necessary files.

If you want to update to a newer automake/libtool version or get errors
about wrong version numbers in m4 run "autoreconf -vfi -I m4" instead.
